# Restaurant-Project-DB
This project contains a collection of SQL queries used to explore and analyze a fictional restaurant database (restaurant_db). It focuses on understanding menu pricing, cuisine categories, customer ordering behavior, and overall sales trends by working with two key tables — menu_items and order_details.


Key Objectives :
Explore the menu items, their prices, categories, and count
Analyze pricing trends, including most/least expensive items overall and within categories
Calculate item counts, category-level summaries, and average prices
Examine order behavior such as number of orders, order size, and order ranges
Identify top-selling and least-ordered items
Combine menu and order tables using joins for deeper insights
Determine highest-spend orders and break down their spending by item category
